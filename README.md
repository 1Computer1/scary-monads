# scary-monads

A proof-of-concept of things in JavaScript almost, but not quite, entirely unlike:

- Algebraic data types
- Type classes
- Do-notation
- Type inference

It is really ugly, to say the least.  
Currently WIP (do I even want to touch this ever again?).  
See test folder for some quick examples.

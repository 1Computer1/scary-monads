# scary-monads

A proof-of-concept of the following things in JavaScript:

- Something like algebraic data types
- Something like type classes
- Something like monads
- Something like do-notation
- Something really ugly

Currently WIP (do I even want to touch this ever again?).  
See test folder for some quick examples.
